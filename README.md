# Current Project
Building a browser version of something betwee a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.  If you move the mouse over the container, random colors will appear on the areas you mouse traverses.  If you move the mouse back over a 'filled in' grid area, then that area will darken by 10%.  10 swipes will darken that square to completely black.

There is also a button at the top of the page. Clicking it will start a prompt asking for how many squares per side you want for the new grid.  Once a number is entered then the grid with the corresponding number of squares will be generated in the container. The container will not change in size, rather the squares will get smaller/or larger to fill the container.
